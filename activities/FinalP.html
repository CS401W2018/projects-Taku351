  <h1>Final Proposal</h1>

  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Takuto Yamashiro</p>
  <p><strong>Class:</strong> CS140</p>

  <h2>Title and Topic</h2>
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> Journey & Frame: A Traveler’s Marketplace</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Topic:</strong> This website will serve as both a travel blog and a place to buy and sell 
    photos. I plan to show my own travel pictures (many in unique frames) and offer a space for people 
    to request photography services. There will be a survey for feedback, a marketplace with a live chat 
    for travelers and remote workers, plus a page for advertisements.
  </p>

  <h2>Why I Chose This Topic</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve always loved visiting new places and taking pictures. By making a site that features my 
    photographs and also allows others to share or request photos, I can build a community around 
    travel and creativity. It also addresses the challenge of finding local photographers when traveling.
