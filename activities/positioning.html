        <p>Whales are a diverse group of fully aquatic marine mammals, primarily consisting of large members of the infraorder Cetacea, which excludes dolphins and porpoises in informal terms. However, dolphins and porpoises are technically considered whales in a more scientific sense. Whales, along with dolphins and porpoises, belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which includes even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are hippopotamuses, from which they split about 54 million years ago. Whales are divided into two subgroups: baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), with their last common ancestor believed to have lived around 34 million years ago. Baleen whales, such as rorquals and right whales, and toothed whales, including species like the sperm whale and belugas, each belong to separate families.

            Whales are fully aquatic and capable of feeding, mating, giving birth, and raising their young in the ocean. They vary greatly in size, from the small dwarf sperm whale to the enormous blue whale, the largest animal ever known to have lived. The sperm whale is the largest predator with teeth on Earth. Some whale species show sexual dimorphism, with females being larger than males.
            
            Baleen whales lack teeth and instead have baleen plates that help them filter large amounts of water to retain krill and plankton. Their large heads, which make up a significant portion of their body mass, and expandable mouths allow them to take in massive volumes of water. Baleen whales also have a strong sense of smell. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth for catching prey like fish or squid. Their excellent hearing, both above and below water, enables them to thrive even in the absence of sight. Some species, like the sperm whale, are particularly adapted for deep diving to hunt prey.

        <h3>What is normal flow in HTML?</h3>
            <p>Normal flow in HTML is how elements are arranged by default: blocks stack vertically, and inline elements sit next to each other.</p>
        <h3>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
            <p>float moves an element left or right, and clearing the float stops layout problems caused by elements wrapping around it.</p>
        <h3>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
            <p>Absolute positions an element relative to its closest container, fixed keeps it in the same place even when scrolling, and relative moves it from its normal spot without affecting other elements.</p>
        <h3>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
            <p>To create nice mobile navigation buttons, make them large, use clear text or icons, ensure they're easy to tap, and use responsive design to fit all screen sizes.</p>
        <h3>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h3>
            <p>Go to the lecture and we can find the video</p>
