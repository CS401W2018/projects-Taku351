        <h3>Japanese Culture</h3>
        <p>One of the japanese culture we proud of is Anime culture, which is expanded to the world thesedays and it is not only for kids, but it is also good for everyone. Throught the animation and story, we can see high technology in the world. It also gives us some lesson that we can learn as well.</p>
