            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can do tasks that normally need human thinking, like making decisions, solving problems, or understanding things. These systems can learn from information and make choices on their own without needing help from people.</p>

            <p>Today, AI is used in many things we use every day. For example, it helps apps suggest TV shows you might like, powers chatbots that answer customer questions quickly, and even helps virtual assistants manage your schedule. AI makes these services smarter and easier to use. Artificial Narrow Inteligence, Natural Language Processing, Artificial General Interigence, Machine Learning, and Artificial Superintelligence are common AI to see in our life.</p>
